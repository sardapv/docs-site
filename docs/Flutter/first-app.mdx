## Features ##

<h3>Hot Reload <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/icons/hot_reload.svg')} height='20'/></h3>

Flutter offers a fast development cycle with *Stateful Hot Reload*, 
the ability to reload the code of a live running app without restarting or losing the app state. 
Make a change to app source, tell your IDE or command-line tool that you want to hot reload, 
and see the change in your simulator, emulator, or device.

**Eg:**

  1. Open ***lib/main.dart***.
  
  2. Change the string on ***`main.dart`***

  ```
  You have pushed the button this many times:
  ```  
  To

  ```
  You have clicked the button this many times:
  ```

  3. You don't need to stop/terminate the app, Just save your changes.

  If you run the app in the terminal, then type **r** in the terminal window to hot reload.

<h3>Hot Restart <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/icons/hot_restart.svg')} height='18'/></h3>

Hot restart loads code changes into the device, and restarts the Flutter app, 
losing the app state. (`⇧ ⌘ \` in IntelliJ and Android Studio for Mac and `Ctrl + Shift + \` in windows, 
`⇧ ⌘ F5` for mac and `Ctrl + Shift + F5` for windows in VSCode).
