[**Flutter**](https://flutter.dev) is Google's UI toolkit for crafting natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebaseðŸš€.

### Why should you choose flutter over other Frameworks ###

Making it more clear, flutter is not Framework like [React](https://reactnative.dev/), [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin), [Angular](https://angular.io/), etc... 
It is an open-source SDK for designing native interfaces for iOS and Android platforms.

**The Reasons to choose flutter**

* Design apps beautifully with less code.
* Easy understandable animations.
* Single codebase for all platforms.
* The best Documentations ever.
* Uses [**Dart**](/docs/Dart/) programming language.
