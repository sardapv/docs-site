The name itself defines it, a block of code that performs a specific task.

### Types of function ###

There are two types of function in C programming:

  * Standard library functions
 
  * User-defined functions

### Standard library functions ###

The standard library functions are built-in functions, such as `main()`, `printf()`, `scanf()`, `sqrt()`, etc...

`main()` function is the primary function that must be the starting point for program execution.

### User-defined functions ###

Functions created by the user are User-defined functions. It can be anything but must be defined by the user.

### Why should you use functions? ###

Because, Dividing complexity into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reuse.

For Example you have 2 jobs to complete work. Then what would you do?

<Tabs
  defaultValue="without func"
  values={[
    { label: 'Without functions', value: 'without func', },
    { label: 'With functions', value: 'with func', },
  ]}>
<TabItem value="without func">

This code is without a function.

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
	//-----job1 start-----//
				|
				|
			some code
				|
				|
	//-----job1 ends-----//

	//-----job2 start-----//
				|
				|
			some code
				|
				|
	//-----job2 ends-----//
	return 0;
}
```

Let us learn how to create and use a function with the below example.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="with func">

This code is with a function.

```c
#include<stdio.h>

void job1(){
	//-----job1 start-----//
				|
				|
			some code
				|
				|
	//-----job1 ends-----//
	return 0;
}

void job2(){
	//-----job2 start-----//
				|
				|
			some code
				|
				|
	//-----job2 ends-----//
}

int main(){
	job1();
	job2();	
	return 0;
}
```
So, What's actually happening there? Well, let it be more clear with the example below.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**<ins>Eg :</ins>**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void functionName()
{
	printf("working on function\n");
}

int main()
{
	printf("main code\n");
	functionName();
}
```

1. We created a function named `functionName()` with a code block of a print statement.

2. We called that function `functionName()` in `main()` function.

That's it, And the out put is

```
main code
working on function
```

There will be more Examples in the  future.

### Pass arguments to a function ###

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) 
{
    int res;
    res = a+b;
    return res;
}

int main(){
	int n1, n2, sum;
    printf("Enter two numbers for addition: \n");
    scanf("%d %d",&n1,&n2);
    sum = add(n1, n2);
	printf("a + b = %d",sum);
	return 0;
}
```

We have `add()` which takes 2 arguments. We follow how the code runs/executes for a better understanding
 * From `main()` function, we take 2 inputs.

 * We are storing the values taken from the user in `n1` and `n2`.

 * Stored values are passed to `sum()` function.

 * As `sum()` function needs 2 `int` variables, the values passed will be assigned to `a`, `b`.

 * Now `a + b` is the [operation](operations) and got result will be assigned to `res` and returned.

 * The returned value of `res` will be assigned to `sum` in `main()` function.

 * Then the sum of 2 numbers will be printed.

Here is the output

```
Enters two numbers for addition: 
5
6
a + b = 11
```

### Recursive function ###

A function that which calls it-self.

Eg: 

```c title="example function"
#include <stdio.h>

void func(int n);

void funcA(int n){
	int i=1;
	if(n<=5)
	{
	    printf("calling function A %d time\n",n);
    	n += i;
	    funcA(n);
	}
}

int main() {
    printf("Hello world\n");
    funcA(1);    
    return 0;
}
```

- From the above code, We can see creating a constructor for the function `funcA()` cause 
we are passing arguments to the function(int n).

- As we said before `a += b` results `a = a + b`. We are adding the `i` value to the current `n` value in function.

- We call the same function inside it-self. As `funcA()` needs an `int` argument to be passed we pass the `n` value.

- When the execution reaches `funcA()`, It checks the n value and validates the `if` condition.

- If the `if` condition satisfies, Then the code block has a function `funcA()`. So, it keeps calling again.

- This leads to a small function loop called recursion.

- When the main function executes, It calls `funcA(1)`.

- On executing the function, it has the same function of it-self.

The output of the above code is

```
Hello world
calling function A 1 time
calling function A 2 time
calling function A 3 time
calling function A 4 time
calling function A 5 time
```
