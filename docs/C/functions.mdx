The name itself defines it, a block of code that performs a specific task.

### Types of function ###

There are two types of function in C programming:

  * Standard library functions
 
  * User-defined functions

### Standard library functions ###

The standard library functions are built-in functions, such as `main()`, `printf()`, `scanf()`, `sqrt()`, etc...

`main()` function is the primary function that must be the starting point for program execution.

### User-defined functions ###

Functions created by the user are User-defined functions. It can be anything but must be defined by the user.

### Why should you use functions? ###

Because, Dividing complexity into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reuse.

For Example you have 2 jobs to complete work. Then what would you do?

<Tabs
  defaultValue="without func"
  values={[
    { label: 'Without functions', value: 'without func', },
    { label: 'With functions', value: 'with func', },
  ]}>
<TabItem value="without func">

This code is without a function.

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
	//-----job1 start-----//
				|
				|
			some code
				|
				|
	//-----job1 ends-----//

	//-----job2 start-----//
				|
				|
			some code
				|
				|
	//-----job2 ends-----//
	return 0;
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="with func">

This code is with a function.

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int job1(){
		//-----job1 start-----//
				|
				|
			some code
				|
				|
	//-----job1 ends-----//
	return 0;
}

int job2(){
	//-----job2 start-----//
				|
				|
			some code
				|
				|
	//-----job2 ends-----//
}

int main(){
	job1();
	job2();	
	return 0;
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

So, What's actually happening there? Well, let it be more clear

**<ins>Eg :</ins>**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void functionName()
{
	printf("working on function\n");
}

int main()
{
	printf("main code\n");
	functionName();
}
```

1. We created a function named `functionName()` with a code block of a print statement.

2. We called that function `functionName()` in `main()` function.

That's it, And the out put is

```
main code
working on function
```

There will be more Examples in the  future.

### Pass arguments to a function ###

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) 
{
    int res;
    res = a+b;
    return res;
}

int main(){
	int n1, n2, sum;
    printf("Enter two numbers for addition: \n");
    scanf("%d %d",&n1,&n2);
    sum = add(n1, n2);
	printf("a + b = %d",sum);
	return 0;
}
```

We have `add()` which takes 2 arguments. We follow how the code runs/executes for a better understanding
 * From `main()` function, we take 2 inputs.

 * We are storing the values taken from the user in `n1` and `n2`.

 * Stored values are passed to `sum()` function.

 * As `sum()` function needs 2 `int` variables, the values passed will be assigned to `a`, `b`.

 * Now `a + b` is the [operation](/docs/c/operations) and got result will be assigned to `res` and returned.

 * The returned value of `res` will be assigned to `sum` in `main()` function.

 * Then the sum of 2 numbers will be printed.

Here is the output

```
Enters two numbers for addition: 
5
6
a + b = 11
```
