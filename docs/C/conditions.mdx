title: Conditions
---

In day to day life we have certain situations where we use conditions.
For example, If it is rainy take an umbrella else no need to bring. The same way
we have particular condition usage scenarios.

### If

Let's see a quick example to understand **if** condition easily.

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
	int a, b;
	printf("Enter values of a and b :\n");
	scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
	// We are comparing a and b values if a > b.
	if(a > b)
	{
		// This will print if the condition satisfies
		printf("a is greater than b");
		return 0;
	}
	// We are comparing a and b values if b > a.
	if(b > a)
	{
		// This will print if the condition satisfies
		printf("b is greater than a");
		return 0;
	}
	printf("nothing satisfied");
    return 0;
}
```

- Hope we don't need any explanation for this if condition. But still I will explain.
- We are taking 2 inputs `a`, `b`.
- We are checking if the given values satisfies the condition.
- If a is greater than b(a > b), then the condition satisfies and continue to the code block and
  prints `a is greater than b` and exits.
- If the condition doesn't satisfy, and `b` is greater than `a`,
  then the `if(a>b)` condition will be skipped and comes to the next line of the code.
- And now the `if(b > a)` condition satisfies here and it prints `b is greater than a` and then exits.
- In case if both didn't satisfy, then it will print `nothing satisfied` cause that is the next line and exits.

You know why it exits? cause we have `return 0` in if conditions. I there is no `return` statement,
then it will also print `nothing satisfied` and then it will exit.

Here is the output

**output 1** (a > b)

```
Enter values of a and b :
8
6
a is greater than b
```

**output 2** (b > a)

```
Enter values of a and b :
10
15
b is greater than a
```

**output 3** (a == b)

```
Enter values of a and b :
6
6
nothing satisfied
```

> If you need you can write
>
> ```c
> if(a == b)
> {
> 	printf("a is equal to b");
> }
> ```
>
> cause there are only these 3 chances.

### Else

Else is an optional condition block for the `if` condition.

Let's see a quick example to understand this easily.

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
	int a, b;
	printf("Enter values of a and b :\n");
	scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
	if(a > b){
		printf("a is greater than b\n");
	} else{
		printf("b is greater than a or a is equal to b\n");
	}
	printf("this line will also print\n");
	return 0;
}
```

**Output 1** (a > b)

```
Enter values of a and b :
6
5
a is greater than b
this line will also print
```

**Output 2** (b > a)

```
Enter values of a and b :
10
15
b is greater than a or a is equal to b
this line will also print
```

- Here we have 3 conditions while comparing 2 numbers.

  1.  Greater than
  2.  Less than
  3.  Equal to

- If 1st condition doesn't satisfy go to the rest. We can simply say,
  we are only filtering the inputs with greater than or not and we aren't minding about other cases.

### else if

If the cases to be checked are more than 2, then we will choose the `else if` condition.

Eg:
Let us take the same example.

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
	int a, b;
	printf("Enter values of a and b :\n");
	scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
	if(a > b)
	{
		printf("a is greater than b");
	}
	else if(b > a)
	{
		printf("b is greater than a");
	}
	else {
		printf("both are equal");
	}
	return 0;
}
```

- As we discussed earlier, we have 3 conditions and we are checking them.
- If `a > b` --> print `a is greater than b`, else if `b > a` --> print `b is greater than a`, else --> print `both are equal`.

> **Note:** We can use if, else, else if conditions as we use in English. Pretty simple right?

### Nested Conditions

Generally nest are made of weaving grass or some other material needed to make a nest.
The same way we will be weaving the condition to make it a **Nested Condition**.
Simply a condition in a condition.

Eg:
Let's compare 3 numbers this time.

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
	int a, b, c;
	printf("Enter values of 3 numbers :\n");
	scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
	// Check if a > b
	if(a > b)
	{
		// If a > b, then check a > c
		if(a > c)
			printf("%d is the greater number of all there numbers.", a);
		// if a < c or a == c
		else
			printf("%d is the greater number of all there numbers.", c);
	}
	// If a < b, then check b > c
	else if(b > c)
		printf("%d is the greater number of all the three numbers.", b);
	// If nothing satisfies then print c is greater
	else
		printf("%d is the greater number of all the three numbers.", c);
	return 0;
}
```

**Output 1**

```
Enter values of 3 numbers :
1
2
3
3 is the greater number of all the three numbers.
```

**Output 2**

```
Enter values of 3 numbers :
3
2
1
3 is the greater number of all the three numbers.
```

**Output 3**

```
Enter values of 3 numbers :
2
3
1
3 is the greater number of all the three numbers.
```

- We will compare `a` and `b`, If `a > b` then understand `b` is not a big number.
- When code moves inside the condition, We will compare `a` and `c`, If `a > c` then `a` is the greater number.
- If `a < c`, then `c` is the greater number.
- If `a < b`, then compare `b` and `c`.
- If `b > c`, then `b` is the greater number.
- If no condition satisfies, then `c` is the greater number.

Didn't you wonder that I haven't used `{}` for `if` and `else`, But still code works?

Because, if the statement is a single line code block you don't need `{}`.
