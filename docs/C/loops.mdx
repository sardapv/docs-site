Loop is nothing but, repeating a process continuously until it reaches a specific condition.
Same way, repeating a code block till it satisfies a condition.

We have 3 types of Loops

- for loop
- while loop
- Do while loop

### For Loop

**Syntax**

```c
for(declaration; condition; statemment/process if condition satisfied)
{
    // Code Block
}
```

Without knowing syntax, It is harder to write loops.

This is how the for loop works

- We will initialize / declare a variable.
- The code block will run until the condition doesn't satisfy.
- The code block will run if the condition satisfy and the expression/statement in the loop will get updated.

Eg:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	// a = 1 ---> Declaring/Initializing value with data type.
	// a < 11 ---> if(a < 11), Checkling if a is less than 11.
	// a++ ---> adding +1 to the value of a if the condition satisfies.
	for (int a = 1; a < 11; a++)
	{
		printf("%d\n", a);
	}
	return 0;
}
```

- Declared `a = 1`, and comparing `1 < 11`, it satisfied and moved to print statement.
- After printing, as the condition satisfied, the code will move to the `a++` statement.
- It increments the value of `a` by one. Now the values is 2, `a = 2`.
- Again it will start from the comparison. And continues until `a < 11`.
- If `a = 11`, `11 < 11` is not satisfying the condition. So it will not move to the print statement.
- The code will come out of the loop. The next continuation code is `return 0`. Sadly, It exits now.

**Output**

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

### While Loop

The While loop doesn't need any variable declaration, statement in it.

Eg:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
	int i = 1;
	// while will have a condition.
	while (i <= 5)
	{
		printf("%d\n", i);
		i++;
	}
	return 0;
}
```

- When `i = 1`, the condition `i <= 5` is true. Hence, the code block of the while loop is executed.
  This prints 1 and the value of i is increased to 2 cause of `i++`.
- Now, `i = 2`, the condition `i <= 5` is again true. The code block of the while loop is executed again.
  This prints 2 and the value of i is increased to 3.
- This process will continue until it becomes 6. When `i = 6`, the condition `i <= 5` will be false and the loop terminates and the code out of the loop will continues.

**Output**

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Do While Loop

Do-While is similar to a while loop. But, Code in Do-While will be executed at least once.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int i, sum = 0;
	// the code block of the loop is executed at least once
	do
	{
		printf("Enter a number: ");
		scanf("%d", &i);
		sum += i;
	}
	while(i > 0);
	printf("Sum = %d",sum);
	return 0;
}
```

- The code in Do will be executed initially. So let us give the value of `i` as 1.
- Then the code will go to `while(i > 0)`, as the entered value is `1`, The condition in while will be satisfied.
- Again the code will move to `do`. This process will continue until you give a number `0`.
- If the number you enter is `0`, the condition in while will bot be satisfied. So it won't go to `do`.
- the next code will be executed. i.e, It prints the sum of all given numbers.

> `sum += i` means `sum = sum + i`. initially `sum = 0`, so when we give `1` the sum will be stored as `sum = 0 + 1`.
> The sum will be stored and when we give a value `2`, `sum = 1 + 2` is the current value that stores in `sum`.

**Output**

```
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 0
Sum = 15
```
