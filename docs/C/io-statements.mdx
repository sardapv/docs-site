title: Input / Output
---

Input and Output is the most important function that a programming language should have. 
We have `printf()` function as printing a statement/output and `scanf()` function for input.

### Output ###

```c
printf("Hello world");
```

You cannot just use `printf()` function. You must include **Standard Input-Output** library as `#include<stdio.h>`.

So this is how the program looks like

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
    printf("Free Learn");
    return 0;
}
```

From the code you doubt what this `main()` is and this `return 0` is. 
You will be learning them in the future here [Functions](functions).

### Input ###

Taking input is the great functionality of a program. 
In **C-Language**, we have the `scanf()` function to take input from the user.

```c
scanf("%d", &someInteger);
```

As we know, must include **Standard Input-Output** library as `#include<stdio.h>` to have any input and output operation.

So this is how the program looks like

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int a;
int main()
{
  printf("Enter a number: ");
  scanf("%d", &a);  
  printf("Number = %d",a);
  return 0;
}
```

What's happening here?

  1. **`int a;`**, we have declared a variable.

  > Note: declaration can be done anywhere. 
    But if we declare outside of the function then the variable can be used in whole over the program.
    If we declare it in a function then the variable can be accessed in that particular function.

  2. **`scanf("%d", &a)`**, Simply we can say it that the program is scanning the input given by the user. 
  **%d** is `int` format specifier.

  > Note: `&` is mandatory in `scanf()`. 
  It means the value entered by the user is storing in the address of the declared variable `a`.

  3. After scanning the input, the program will print the value of `a` taken from the user.

  So the output will be this

  ```
  Enter a number: 10
  Number = 10
  ```
