title: Break - Continue
---

### Break

The break statement ends the loop immediately when it is found.

Eg:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int a, sum = 0;
	// Sum of 10 or fewer numbers
	for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
		printf("Enter number%d: ", i);
		scanf("%d", &a);
		// if the user enters 0, break the loop
		if (a <= 0) {
				break;
		}
		// sum = sum + a
		sum += a;
	}
	printf("Sum = %d", sum);
	return 0;
}
```

- Here The code is the same as we have seen before. But what changed?
- We have added a `break` statement in the `if` condition.
- You can think, **why can't we use `return 0`?**. Yes we can use it too, but it will terminate the whole program.
- Break will just break the particular code block not the whole program.
- In the above code we have used `break` in a condition `a <= 0`. 
If the input is less than `0` or equal to `0`, the for loop breaks.

**Output**
```
Enter number1: 1
Enter number2: 2
Enter number3: 3
Enter number4: 0
Sum = 6
```
### Continue

The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration.

Eg:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int a, sum = 0;
	// Sum of 10 or fewer numbers
	for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
		printf("Enter number%d: ", i);
		scanf("%d", &a);
		// if the user enters 0, break the loop
		if (a <= 0) {
			continue;
		}
		// sum = sum + a
		sum += a;
	}
	printf("Sum = %d", sum);
	return 0;
}
```

- Let us take the above example and replace `break` with `continue`.
- Now what happens is, the numbers equal to `0` or less than `0` are not taken to the Sum.
- The loop won't break instead it will continue but won't count the numbers given if the condition doesn't satisfy.

**Output**

```
Enter number1: 0
Enter number2: -8
Enter number3: 1
Enter number4: 2
Enter number5: -9
Enter number6: 3
Enter number7: -7
Enter number8: 4
Enter number9: 5
Enter number10: 0
Sum = 15
```
