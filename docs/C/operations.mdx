### Operator

A symbol that operates the [operands](#operand).

Eg:

```c
sum = a + b;
```

- Here `+` is the operator.

### Operand

A value or variable that which is operated.

- In the above example `a`, `b` are operands.

### Types of Operators

| Operators                 |           Operations           |
| ------------------------- | :----------------------------: |
| <p align="center">+</p>   |            Addition            |
| <p align="center">-</p>   |          subtraction           |
| <p align="center">\*</p>  |         Multiplication         |
| <p align="center">/</p>   |            Division            |
| <p align="center">%</p>   |   Remainder(Modulo Division)   |
| <p align="center">=</p>   |       assigning a value        |
| <p align="center">==</p>  | Comparing the values(Equal to) |
| <p align="center">!=</p>  |          Not equal to          |
| <p align="center"><</p>   |           Less than            |
| <p align="center">\></p>  |          Greater than          |
| <p align="center"><=</p>  |     Less than or equal to      |
| <p align="center">>&&</p> |      Logical AND operator      |
| <p align="center">>!!</p> |      Logical OR operator       |
| <p align="center">>!</p>  |      Logical NOT operator      |

Eg:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
	int a, b;
	printf("Enter values of a and b :\n");
	scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
	// a + b gives the result to the sum of a and b
	printf("Result for Sum of a and b = %d", a+b);
	// a - b gives the result to the difference b/w a and b
	printf("Result for Subtracting  b from a = %d", a-b);
	// a * b gives the result to the product of a and b
	printf("Result for Product of a and b = %d", a*b);
	// a / b gives the result to the quotient of a and b
	printf("The Result for Dividing a with b = %d", a/b);
	// a % b gives the result to the remainder of a divided by b
	printf("The Remainder of a divided by b = %d", a%b);
	return 0;
}
```

Here is the output

```
Enter values of a and b :
4
2
Result for Sum of a and b = 6
Result for Subtracting  b from a = 2
Result for Product of a and b = 8
The Result for Dividing a with b = 2
The Remainder of a divided by b = 0
```

### Value Reusage

If you want to use the values somewhere, then store them in a variable.

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
	// Declaring variables as per the operation.
	int a, b, c, d, e;
	printf("Enter values of a and b :\n");
	// Taking 2 inputs.
	scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
	// Adding them and storing/assigning the value to c.
	c = a+b;
	printf("The Sum of a and b is %d\n", c);
	printf("Enter some value to subtract from %d\n", c);
	// Taking one more variable to subtract from the c value.
	scanf("%d", &d);
	// Subtracting d from c and storing/assigning the value to e.
	e = c-d;
	printf("After subtracting %d from %d, the result is %d\n", d, c, e);
	return 0;
}
```

The result will be

```
Enter values of a and b :
15
12
The sum of a and b is 27
Enter some value to subtract from 27
5
After subtracting 5 from 27, the result is 22
```
