### Keywords ###

Keywords are predefined, reserved words in a programming language that have specific meaning to the compiler.

Eg: 
    
```c
int items;
```

Here ***int*** is a predefined Keyword and ***items*** is a [variable](/) of assigned type **int**

### Identifiers ###

An Identifier is a name of alphanumeric characters that begins with an alphabetic 
character or an underscore character that is used to represent various programming elements such as variables, 
functions, arrays, structures, unions, and so on. 

  * An identifier is a user-defined word.

  Eg: `int items`

    Here `items` is an identifier
  
  > **NOTE:** Identifiers must be different from [keywords](/docs/c/basics#keywords).

### Constants ###

Define a variable with a constant value using `const`.

  Eg: 
  ```c
  const int items = 10;
  ```

  As we have added the keyword `const`, we can't assign another value to `items`.

### Variables ###

A variable is a data storage area(container) to hold data of an [Identifier](/docs/c/basics#identifiers).

  Eg: 
  ```c
  int items = 10;
  ```

  Here, We have assigned a value `10` to `items`. So the `items` identifier will keep holding 
  the value through the code till the value changes(a different value is assigned).

### Data Types ###

Simply, The data type is a type of data. 
There are predefined data-types like **int**, **float**, **char**, **bool**, etc ...

#### <ins>int</ins> ####

`int` is used for declaring Integer values.

  Eg: 
  ```c
  int id;
  ```

  We can assign any value to variable `id` from **-2147483648** to **2147483647**.

  * The size of int is 4 bytes (32 bits).

#### <ins>char</ins> ####

`char` is used for declaring the character type variable.

  Eg:
  ```c
  char name = 'a';
  ```

  variable `name` is a data type of `char` which can hold any character.

  * The size of the character variable is 1 byte.

  > **NOTE:** characters value must be assigned within a `''` or `""`.

#### <ins>float</ins> ####

`float` is used for declaring Real numbers.

  Eg:
  ```c
  float part = 20.354;
  ```

  We can also assign exponentials for floating points in the value.

  ```c
  float expoPart = 20.35e4;
  ```

#### <ins>string</ins> ####

A string is a data type used in programming, 
such as an integer and floating-point unit, but is used to represent text rather than numbers

  Eg:
  ```c
  char c[] = "Free Learn";

  char c[50] = "Free Learn";

  char c[] = {'F', 'r', 'e', 'e'};

  char c[6] = {'L', 'e', 'a', 'r', 'n'};
  ```

#### <ins>bool</ins> ####

A boolean is a data type that can store true or false value.

  Eg:
  ```c
  bool isLoading = flase;
  ```

#### <ins>Enumerated</ins> ####

Enumeration (or enum) is a user-defined data type in C. 
It is mainly used to assign names to integral constants, 
the names make a program easy to read and maintain.

  * Can also be a subtype of an integer.

  * The values will be assigned by default.

  Eg:
  ```c
  enum items { item1, item2, item3};
  ```

  From the above statement initially the value of `item1` will be `0` 
  and others will be incremental like `item2` is `1` and `item3` is `2`.

  if we have declared value as shown

  ```c
  enum items { item1 = 4, item2, item3 = 10, item4};
  ```

  then the value of `item1` will be `4` as we have assigned and automatically the value of `item2` will be `5`
  and the value of `item4` will be `11` as it's previous `item3`'s assigned value is `10`.

### Derived Data Types ###

Data types are derived from fundamental data types.

  Eg: Arrays, Pointers, Function Types, Structures, etc...

#### <ins>Arrays</ins> ####

Arrays can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

  **declaration**
  ```c
  dataType arrayName[arraySize];
  ```

  Eg:
  ```c
  char array[5] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'};
  ```

#### <ins>Pointers</ins> ####

Special variables that are used to store addresses rather than values.

  Eg: 
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main()
  {
    int a = 5;
    /// This prints the value of `a`
    printf("a: %d\n", a);
    // This prints the address of `a`
    printf("address of a: %p", &a);
    return 0;
  }
  ```

  **Output**
  
  ```
  a: 5
  address of a: 0x7ffe35fcbf3c
  ```
