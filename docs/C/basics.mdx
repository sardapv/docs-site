### Keywords ###

Keywords are predefined, reserved words in a programming language that have specific meaning to the compiler.

Eg: 
    
```c
int items;
```

Here ***int*** is a predefined Keyword and ***items*** is a [variable](/) of assigned type **int**

### Identifiers ###

An Identifier is a name of alphanumeric characters that begins with an alphabetic 
character or an underscore character that is used to represent various programming elements such as variables, 
functions, arrays, structures, unions, and so on. 

  * An identifier is a user-defined word.

  Eg: `int items`

    Here `items` is an identifier
  
  > **NOTE:** Identifiers must be different from [keywords](basics#keywords).

### Constants ###

Define a variable with a constant value using `const`.

  Eg: 
  ```c
  const int items = 10;
  ```

  As we have added the keyword `const`, we can't assign another value to `items`.

### Variables ###

A variable is a data storage area(container) to hold data of an [Identifier](basics#identifiers).

  Eg: 
  ```c
  int items = 10;
  ```

  Here, We have assigned a value `10` to `items`. So the `items` identifier will keep holding 
  the value through the code till the value changes(a different value is assigned).

### Data Types ###

Simply, The data type is a type of data. 
There are predefined data-types like **int**, **float**, **char**, **bool**, etc ...

#### <ins>int</ins> ####

`int` is used for declaring Integer values.

  Eg: 
  ```c
  int id;
  ```

  We can assign any value to variable `id` from **-2147483648** to **2147483647**.

  * The size of int is 4 bytes (32 bits).

#### <ins>char</ins> ####

`char` is used for declaring the character type variable.

  Eg:
  ```c
  char name = 'a';
  ```

  variable `name` is a data type of `char` which can hold any character.

  * The size of the character variable is 1 byte.

  > **NOTE:** characters value must be assigned within a `''` or `""`.

#### <ins>float</ins> ####

`float` is used for declaring Real numbers.

  Eg:
  ```c
  float part = 20.354;
  ```

  We can also assign exponentials for floating points in the value.

  ```c
  float expoPart = 20.35e4;
  ```

#### <ins>string</ins> ####

A string is a data type used in programming, 
such as an integer and floating-point unit, but is used to represent text rather than numbers

  Eg:
  ```c
  char c[] = "Free Learn";

  char c[50] = "Free Learn";

  char c[] = {'F', 'r', 'e', 'e'};

  char c[6] = {'L', 'e', 'a', 'r', 'n'};
  ```

#### <ins>bool</ins> ####

A boolean is a data type that can store true or false values.

  Eg:
  ```c
  bool isLoading = false;
  ```

#### <ins>Enumerated</ins> ####

Enumeration (or enum) is a user-defined data type in C. 
It is mainly used to assign names to integral constants, 
the names make a program easy to read and maintain.

  * Can also be a subtype of an integer.

  * The values will be assigned by default.

  Eg:
  ```c
  enum items { item1, item2, item3};
  ```

  From the above statement initially the value of `item1` will be `0` 
  and others will be incremental like `item2` is `1` and `item3` is `2`.

  if we have declared value as shown

  ```c
  enum items { item1 = 4, item2, item3 = 10, item4};
  ```

  then the value of `item1` will be `4` as we have assigned and automatically the value of `item2` will be `5`
  and the value of `item4` will be `11` as it's previous `item3`'s assigned value is `10`.

### Derived Data Types ###

Data types are derived from fundamental data types.

  Eg: Arrays, Pointers, Function Types, Structures, etc...

#### <ins>Arrays</ins> ####

Arrays can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. In simple words, 
Collection of data of similar/different data types.

  **declaration**
  ```c
  dataType arrayName[arraySize];
  ```

  Eg:
  ```c
  char array[5] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'};
  ```

:::info Arrays
Usage and types of arrays will be available in [Additional Content](additional)
:::

#### <ins>Pointers</ins> ####

Special variables that are used to store addresses rather than values.

  Eg: 
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main()
  {
    int a = 5, *b;
    b = &a;
    /// This prints the value of `a`
    printf("value of a: %d\n", *b);
    // This prints the address of `a`
    printf("address of a: %p", b);
    return 0;
  }
  ```

  **Output**
  
  ```
  value of a: 5
  address of a: 0x7ffe35fcbf3c
  ```

:::note
We should declare a pointer with `*`. If you declare a pointer then,
`*x` will help to store the value, `x` will help to store the address.
:::

:::info Pointers
Usage and types of pointers will be available in [Additional Content](additional)
:::
### Global Variables ###

Any variable that declared out side a function can be accessed anywhere in the file, called **Global variable**.

Eg:
```c title="Global variable"
#include<stdio.h>

int a = 2, b = 3;

int main(){
  printf("Sum of a and b = %d\n", a+b);
  function();
  return 0;
}

void function(){
  printf("Value of a : %d\n", a);
  printf("Value of b : %d\n", b);
}
```
**Output**
```
Sum of a and b = 5
```
- `a`, `b` are global variables.

### Local Variables ###

Any variable that declared inside a function can be accessed locally in the [function](functions)/method, called **Local variable**.

Eg:
```c title="Local variable"
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
  int a = 2, b = 3;
  printf("Sum of a and b = %d\n", a+b);
  function();
  return 0;
}

void function(){
  printf("Value of a : %d\n", a);
  printf("Value of b : %d\n", b);
}
```
**Output**
```console
D:\Programs\C>gcc basics.c
basics.c: In function 'main':
basics.c:6:3: warning: implicit declaration of function 'function' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    6 |   function();
      |   ^~~~~~~~
basics.c: At top level:
basics.c:10:6: warning: conflicting types for 'function'
   10 | void function(){
      |      ^~~~~~~~
basics.c:6:3: note: previous implicit declaration of 'function' was here
    6 |   function();
      |   ^~~~~~~~
basics.c: In function 'function':
basics.c:11:31: error: 'a' undeclared (first use in this function)
   11 |   printf("Value of a : %d\n", a);
      |                               ^
basics.c:11:31: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
```

- The error is because, `a`, `b` are local variables, they can be only accessed in the main function only.

### Static Variables ###

The value of a static variable continues to exist until the end of the program.

Eg:

```c title="Static Variable"
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
  function();
  function();
  function();
  return 0;
}

void function(){
  static int a = 1;
  a += 3;
  printf("Value of a : %d\n", a);
}
```

- we are declaring a static variable `a = 1`. That is incremented with 3.

- When we initially call the function `function()`, the value will be printing as `4`, cause we incremented  it.

- When we call the function again, the value of `a` will be carried as the value we got when that has been incremented i.e, `4`.

- So in the second call the value of `a` becomes `4` and that will be incremented to `4+3`. And this repeats. 

- Until the program exits/ends, the value of `a` will remain the latest value it got.

- Here is the Output

```console title="output"
Value of a : 4
Value of a : 7
Value of a : 10
```
