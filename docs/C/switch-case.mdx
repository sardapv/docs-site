title: Switch Case
---

Switch case is pretty similar to `if...else...if` ladder.
The expressions are compared like `if` statement does.

- If it matches, the code bolck will run until it finds `break`.

- If it doesn't match, the expression will be moving to next expression.

Eg: Let us try operations.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char operator;
    int n1, n2;

    printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \n");
    printf("1. Addition(+)\n2. Subtraction(-)\n3. Multiplication(*)\n");
    scanf("%c", &operator);
    printf("Enter two numbers: \n");
    scanf("%d %d",&n1, &n2);

    switch(operator)
    {
        case '+':
            printf("Sum is %d", n1+n2);
            break;

        case '-':
            printf("Difference is %d", n1-n2);
            break;

        case '*':
            printf("Product is %d", n1*n2);
            break;

        // operator doesn't match
        default:
            printf("Sorry! operator is not correct");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

- This is the output

    correct output

```
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): 
1. Addition(+)
2. Subtraction(-)
3. Multiplication(*)
+
Enter two numbers: 
1
2
Sum is 3
```

  Incorrect output

```
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): 
1. Addition(+)
2. Subtraction(-)
3. Multiplication(*)
^
Enter two numbers: 
1
2
Sorry! operator is not correct
```

> If you want to ask the question again, write the cases in a function and call the function.
```c
void cases(){
    char operator;
    int n1, n2;
    printf("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): \n");
    printf("1. Addition(+)\n2. Subtraction(-)\n3. Multiplication(*)\n");
    scanf("%c", &operator);
    printf("Enter two numbers: \n");
    scanf("%d %d",&n1, &n2);
    switch(operator)
    {
        case '+':
            printf("Sum is %d", n1+n2);
            break;
        case '-':
            printf("Difference is %d", n1-n2);
            break;
        case '*':
            printf("Product is %d", n1*n2);
            break;
        // operator doesn't match
        default:
            printf("Sorry! operator is not correct\n");
            // If the choise is incorrect it will again call the function.
            // This will be a loop till you give correct operation.
            cases();
    }
}
```
Call this when ever you want.
```c
#include<stdio.h>
//----- Write the cases function here -----//
int main(){
    cases();
    return 0;
}
```

:::caution
1. `break` is mandatory when using switch cases, else the rest of the code will also keep running.
`break` is similarly like `return`, But `return` returns some value where `break` doesn't.

2. `default` case is not mandatory.

3. You can assume `case` as `if` condition and `default` as `else` statement. Where `if-else` will have `return`
and `switch-cases` will have `break`.
