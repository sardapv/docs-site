# Basics

:::caution New Here?
If you are completely new to the programming world,
Then we would recommend you to jump over to [C-Language](/docs/C/).
Cause Dart is very similar to C-Lang code structure, 
And also we have covered most of the content helpful to programming 
languages.

## Input / Output ##

Input and output are pretty easy in the dart. Other than a console application,
Inputs aren't used much.

### Output ###

`print()` and `stdout.write()` are the output statements we generally in the dart.

```dart title="main.js"
import "dart:io";

void main(){
    stdout.write('Hello world');
}
```

```console title="Output"
Hello world
```

### Input ###

To take an input we must import the `dart:io` library. 
`stdin.readLineSync()` is the input statement in dart.

:::note NOTE
- `stdin` and `stdout` needs dart's input-ouput library(`dart:io`).

- `stdin` only reads String values
:::

```dart
import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  stdout.write("Enter a number: ");
  // Reading the user input as a string.
  var string = stdin.readLineSync();
  // Trying to Parse the string into int as num.
  var num = int.tryParse(string);
  // If the num is null
  if (num == null) {
    return print("That's not a valid integer. :(");
  }
  // if the num is not null(else statement).
  else {
    var square = num * num;
    // returning the result as a square if it is a success.
    return print("The square of your number is $square!");
  }
}
```
